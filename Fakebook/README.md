# Fakebook

Really simple project, i want to clone visually the front-end of the Facebook login page and the main page using HTML/CSS and JS. I will not connect it to a back-end server, because the goal here is to make the HMTL/CSS stick in my head for advancing next in back-end dev.

Currently working on user page (see second model), i'm approaching the final result and beginning finitions. I finished all the top of the page, aligning like the original site, and displaying it correctly. I worked on the center container too. Welcome page finished, currently working on responsive for login page and welcome page. My two pages are now fully responsive, the login page for mobile and the home page for mobile and tablets.

Beginning the user page, please see third model below. I had a thought about this project, the more interesting about it is that i want a sandbox for my future learning of back-end, not to show-case my work. I want something clean, yet functionnal, i'll let all the readme, but i'll stop working on the pages other than the login. For curious peoples, my original and not finished work is in <i><b>Site before remastering</i></b> folder.
