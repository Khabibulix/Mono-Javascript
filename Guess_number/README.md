# To-Do-List-Vanilla-JS
Easy project in Vanilla JS.

Simply guess the Number game. A number is randomly generated by the browser, the user has 10 tests to find it, which is materialized by a counter. The number is between 0 and 100,
it can't be negative, over or under, if it is, the browser alerts. At each input, the browser responds with a higher or a smaller answer. 

My bad, the browser speaks in french, but translation is simple.
